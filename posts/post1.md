title: "I've graduated. What now?"
---

Welcome to /blog/[id], where i'd intended to start putting what i find interesting into words. Ideally it'd be a culmination of knowledge i wish to reference from time to time, but it pays to start this off with a little more personal touch.

### Arrival Disorientation
> "how do you describe the feeling where you knew you always wanted to reach there but when you finally did, you feel lost"
Chatgpt says that
> this feeling can be described as "arrival disorientation" - a sense of emptiness after achieving something you always wanted. It's a bittersweet mix of fulfilment and loss, where the drive that propelled you forward suddenly dissipates, leaving a void. 
> This feeling often stems from:
> - Purpose misalignment: The journey toward the goal gave your life structure, and now that it’s gone, you feel aimless.
> - Expectation vs. reality gap: The moment of arrival may not feel as transformative as you envisioned.
> - Identity shift: You’ve tied so much of your identity to striving for the goal that you’re unsure who you are without it.
> It's common, and reflecting on new aspirations or deeper purposes often helps to reignite that sense of direction.

Have never bothered so much about this, but at the same time have never realised what causes it, and what comes out of this feeling. Well, atleast the last line of response was re-assuring. I think a large part stems from the uncertainty of what the future is going to be like. Is this the job i wanted? How's my boss going to be? How will this decision affect my career trajectory (i.e will it be hard to switch back to a role i want)? 


### Building this 
Thought this was doable in a day but writing this at 12.24am and i'm only partially satisfied with how this site turned out. A lot of time was spent greasing my frontend gears that probably never really ran since my frontend internship, and also figuring out how this site should be. 

This is a list of things i was trying to achieve (in order of importance):
1. Make it easy to update the blog. *With nextjs dynamic routes and remark markdown parsing, i basically only need to write my content in a .md and the ci/cd does its job*
2. Cut out fancy animation and (try to) minimise the amount of cognitive load. *I firmly believe there's a limit to how many words you can read a day and because of that there should be an **efficient** use of text/ elements here.* 
3. Viewing width should be functional. *Adobe acrobat reader doesnt bombard your eyes with text spanning the entire window just because your monitor is that wide. I also wanted to make it feel like you're accessing this from an ipad on focused mode*

The solutions for these 3 points seem to be good enough so far, until markdown becomes a hassle to write then we can probably look into converters. Anyway, if you're reading this, thank you for being part of the site traffic. Hope you agree with me on points 2 and 3, and if not feel free to give me feedback via socials
