Welcome to `/blog`, where my intention is to put down what i find interesting into words. Ideally it'd be a culmination of knowledge i wish to reference from time to time, but it pays to start this off with a little more personal touch.

### Arrival Disorientation
Had this on my mind for awhile now.
> how do you describe the feeling where you knew you always wanted to reach there but when you finally did, you feel lost?

Chatgpt says:

> this feeling can be described as 'arrival disorientation' - a sense of emptiness after achieving something you always wanted. It's a bittersweet mix of fulfilment and loss, where the drive that propelled you forward suddenly dissipates, leaving a void. 
> This feeling often stems from: 
> - Purpose misalignment: The journey toward the goal gave your life structure, and now that itâ€™s gone, you > feel aimless.
> - Expectation vs. reality gap: The moment of arrival may not feel as transformative as you envisioned.
> - Identity shift: Youâ€™ve tied so much of your identity to striving for the goal that youâ€™re unsure who you are without it.
> It's common, and reflecting on new aspirations or deeper purposes often helps to reignite that sense of direction.  


This has never bothered me that much, but at the same time i've never come to realise what causes it.

Well, atleast the last line of response was re-assuring. I think a large part stems from the uncertainty of what the future is going to be like post-graduation.


### Doing this 
Writing this at 1.29am but only half as much satisfied with how it turned out. Given that this is fundamentally in js/html/css, a ton of time was spent greasing frontend gears (that probably never really ran since i did it in an internship 2 years ago). 

Also, a huge portion of time was spent figuring out how this site should turn out. And yes there was no wireframe or plan whatsoever.

This is a list of things i was trying to achieve (of decreasing importance):
1. Make it easy to update the blog. 
   
   *nextjs [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) and [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) markdown parsing, i basically only need to write my content in .md and the ci/cd does its job*
2. Cut out fancy animation and (try to) minimise the amount of cognitive load. 
   
   *firm believer of there being a limit to how many words you can read a day and because of that there should be an **efficient** use of text/ elements here*
3. Viewing width should be functional. 
   
   *Adobe acrobat reader doesnt bombard your eyes with text spanning the entire window just because your monitor is that wide. Wanted replicate it through this layout somehow*


This workaround seems to be enough so far, until markdown becomes a hassle to write..then we can probably look into converters. 

Anyway, if you're reading this, thank you for being part of the ðŸš¥ site traffic. Feel free to reach out if you catch bugs or have feedback
