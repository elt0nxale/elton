title: "I've graduated. What now?"

Welcome to `/blog`, where i'd intended to put down what i find interesting into words. 

Ideally it'd be a culmination of knowledge i wish to reference from time to time, but it pays to start this off with a little more personal touch.

### Arrival Disorientation
> how do you describe the feeling where you knew you always wanted to reach there but when you finally did, you feel lost

Chatgpt says that ðŸ’­ 

> this feeling can be described as 'arrival disorientation' - a sense of emptiness after achieving something you always wanted. It's a bittersweet mix of fulfilment and loss, where the drive that propelled you forward suddenly dissipates, leaving a void. 
> This feeling often stems from: 
> - Purpose misalignment: The journey toward the goal gave your life structure, and now that itâ€™s gone, you > feel aimless.
> - Expectation vs. reality gap: The moment of arrival may not feel as transformative as you envisioned.
> - Identity shift: Youâ€™ve tied so much of your identity to striving for the goal that youâ€™re unsure who you are without it.
> It's common, and reflecting on new aspirations or deeper purposes often helps to reignite that sense of direction.  


I've never bothered so much about this feeling, but at the same time i have never come to realise what causes it, and what could come out of this feeling.

Well, atleast the last line of response was re-assuring. I think a large part stems from the uncertainty of what the future is going to be like. *Is this the job i wanted? How's my boss going to be? How will this decision affect my career trajectory Will it be hard to switch back to a role i want? *


### Building this 
Writing this at 1.29am ðŸ˜´ but i'm only partially satisfied with how this site turned out. Given that this is entirely in javascript html and css, a shit ton of time was spent greasing my frontend gears that probably never really ran since my frontend internship. Also a huge portion of time was spent figuring out how this site should turn out, and yes there was no wireframe or plan involved.

This is a list of things i was trying to achieve (in order of importance):
1. Make it easy to update the blog. 
   > *With [nextjs dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) and [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) markdown parsing, i basically only need to write my content in .md and the ci/cd does its job*
2. Cut out fancy animation and (try to) minimise the amount of cognitive load. 
   > *I firmly believe there's a limit to how many words you can read a day and because of that there should be an **efficient** use of text/ elements here.* 
3. Viewing width should be functional. 
   > *Adobe acrobat reader doesnt bombard your eyes with text spanning the entire window just because your monitor is that wide. I also wanted to make it feel like you're accessing this from an ipad on focused mode*


The solutions seem to be enough so far, until markdown becomes a hassle to write..then we can probably look into converters. 

Anyway, if you're reading this, thank you for being part of the ðŸš¥ site traffic. Hope you agree with me on points 2 and 3, and if not feel free to give me feedback via socials ðŸ“­
